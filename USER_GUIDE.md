# TwoAuth User Guide

Welcome to TwoAuth! This guide will help you get started with securing your accounts.

### 1. Installation (Progressive Web App)

TwoAuth is designed to work like a native app on your phone or computer without needing an app store.

1.  On your mobile or desktop browser, navigate to the application's URL.
2.  Your browser will likely prompt you to install the app or add it to your home screen.
    *   On **Mobile**, use the "Share" or "Settings" icon in your browser and select **"Add to Home Screen"**.
    *   On **Desktop** (e.g., Chrome, Edge), look for an "Install" icon in the address bar.
3.  Once installed, the TwoAuth icon will appear on your home screen or in your applications list.

### 2. Setting Your Master Password

The first time you open TwoAuth, you will be prompted to create a Master Password.

-   **This is the only key to your vault.** Choose a password that is both strong and memorable.
-   **We cannot recover this password for you.** If you lose it, you will lose access to all your stored codes unless you have set up recovery options.

### 3. Adding Your First Code

You can add new authentication codes in several ways from the main screen:

-   **Add Manually:** Tap the "Add Manually" button and fill in the details provided by the service you are securing (e.g., Issuer, Secret Key).
-   **From Image:** If you have a QR code saved as an image in your gallery, use the "From Image" option to scan it directly. The app will automatically fill in the details for you.

### 4. Managing Your Codes

-   **View a Code:** By default, codes are hidden. Tap on a code card to reveal the 6-digit number.
-   **Copy a Code:** Use the copy icon next to the code to quickly copy it to your clipboard.
-   **View Additional Info:** If a code has extra details (like an associated email or account name), an "Info" icon will be visible. Tapping it flips the card to show this information.
-   **Move to Trash:** Use the trash icon to move a code you no longer need to the Trash. Codes in the trash can be restored or permanently deleted from the Trash screen, accessible from the header on the main page.
