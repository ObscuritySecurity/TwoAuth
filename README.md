  TwoAuth

> **Respect for the people behind the screen.**

TwoAuth is a two-factor authentication (2FA) application built on a simple and radical idea: **respect for the user**.

---

## Why TwoAuth?

For a simple 6-digit code, you usually provide:

- Your Location 
- Device information 
- IP address 
- Date of behavior 
- And more 

And yes — it's "free." 

But **you are the product**.

We say **"Enough of this."**  
So I built something different.
