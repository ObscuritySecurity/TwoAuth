TwoAuth respects the people behind the screen. It's a 2FA app built on a simple, radical idea: no tracking, no ads, no data collection. Using a 100% client-side architecture and strong end-to-end encryption (AES-GCM), your sensitive data is protected and never leaves your device.

TwoAuth is compliant with the protocol and respects all the principles included in it: https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/protocol-3305

### Key Features

-   **Fortress-Grade Security:** A 100% client-side architecture means no remote servers, no databases, and no external attack surface. All data is encrypted with AES-GCM and stored exclusively on your device.
-   **Universal Access:** Functions on any modern browser as a Progressive Web App (PWA), providing a native-app experience without the need for an app store.
-   **Secure Backup & Restore:** Encrypted backup options give you full control over your data portability and security.
-   **Advanced Local Protection:** Built-in defenses against brute-force attacks and an optional self-destruct mechanism provide multiple layers of security against unauthorized local access.
-   **Clean & Intuitive Interface:** A focused user experience powered by React and ShadCN UI makes managing your authentication codes effortless.
