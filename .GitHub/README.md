TwoAuth respects the people behind the screen. It's a 2FA app built on a simple, radical idea: no tracking, no ads, no data collection. Using a 100% client-side architecture and strong end-to-end encryption (AES-GCM), your sensitive data is protected and never leaves your device.

TwoAuth is compliant with the protocol and respects all the principles included in it: [protocol-3305](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/protocol-3305)
